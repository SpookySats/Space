Welcome to the Spooky Space! This dApp allows users to buy and own NFTs representing virtual space on a 50x50 grid. Each NFT represents a specific Space on the grid, with a customizable title, image, and link associated with it. Users can buy Space with TFUEL, and can update the information associated with their NFTs at any time, only paying for gas. A free Spooky Collectible can be minted, which unlocks the canvas to purchase a Space.

# How to Buy a Space
- Connect to Metamask: Ensure that you are connected to your Metamask and connected to Theta Mainnet.
- Claim your free Spooky Collectible: To unlock the canvas, you will need to claim your free Spooky Collectible on the Claim your Spooky tab.
- Go back to the canvas tab and select your Space size: Click on the 'Select Space' button to choose the size of the Space you want to buy.
- Fill in the following information to the block:
    - Space Name
    - Image URL link: must be linked directly to the image (e.g., https://i.imgur.com/3rYHhEu.jpeg)
    - Link that you will go to if your Space is clicked.
    - Claim your Space: After filling in the required information, click on the 'Claim your Space' button. Wait for the transaction to complete, and your space will be officially purchased.

Congratulations! You have now successfully purchased a Space.
